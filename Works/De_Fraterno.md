> That Plutarch wrote this work after De Adulatore et Amico, De Amicorum Multitudine,1 and the Life of Cato Minor was demonstrated by C. Brokate (De aliquot Plui. libellis, diss. Göttingen, 1913, pp. 17-24, 58; and see the excellent tables on pp. 47, 61). Plutarch appears to have retained a certain amount of more or less irrelevant material on friendship from his recent work on these treatises, and also to have drawn upon some portions of Theophrastus's treatise On Friendship.2


P. Mentions a visit to Rome (Perseus, section 4, 479e)

> I remember, for instance, that in Rome I undertook to arbitrate between two brothers, of whom one had the reputation of being a philosopher. But he was, as it appears, not only as a brother but also as a philosopher, masquerading under a false name and appellation ; for when I asked him to conduct himself as brother to brother and as philosopher to layman, ‘What you say,’ said he, ‘as to his being a layman, is correct, but I account it no momentous or important matter to have sprung from the same loins.’ ‘As for you,’ said I, ‘it is obvious that you [p. 257] consider it no important or momentous matter to have sprung from any loins at all.’ 

Also has some interesting notes on the idea of equality and inequality (12):

> When Solon,1 speaking of principles of government, said that equality does not create sedition, he was thought to be playing up too much to the crowd by introducing an arithmetical proportion, a democratic principle,2 instead of the sound geometrical proportion.3 As for a man who gives advice to brothers in the matter of a family estate after the manner of Plato's4 advice to the citizens of his state, to abolish, if possible, the notion of ‘mine’ and ‘not mine,’ but if he cannot do this, to cherish equality and cling to it, and thus lays a fair and abiding5 foundation of concord and peace, let him also make use of eminent precedents, such as that reply of Pittacus to the king of Lydia6 who inquired if Pittacus had money : ‘Twice as much,’ said he, ‘as I would wish, now that my brother is dead.’ But since it is not only the getting of money and the losing of it that makes ‘less grow hostile to more,’ 7 but in general, as Plato8 says, in inequality movement is produced and in equality rest and repose ; thus all [p. 283] manner of inequality is dangerous as likely to foster brothers' quarrels, and though it is impossible for them to be equal and on the same footing in all respects
