Advice to newlyweds.  A  heartfelt depiction of a traditional, patriarchal marriag but one which belies some of the worst stererotypes about marital relations in Greece. This is a fairly famnous piece in antiquity, quoted by Stobaeus,  Jerome [Against Jovinian](https://www.newadvent.org/fathers/30091.htm) and others.
