# Scolus

A ruined town on the road from Thebes to Plataea https://pleiades.stoa.org/places/541106/?searchterm=scolus*.  A famously depressing location:  "Scolus was so disagreeable and rugged (τραχύς) that it gave rise to the proverb, “never let us go to Scolus, nor follow any one there” (Strabo, 2.933).  Mentioned in Homer

Pausanias:

>  On the road from Plataea to Thebes is the river Oeroe, said to have been a daughter of the Asopus. Before crossing the Asopus, if you turn aside to lower ground in a direction parallel to the river, after about forty stades you come to the ruins of Scolus. The temple of Demeter and the Maid among the ruins is not finished, and only half-finished are the images of the goddesses. Even to-day the Asopus is the boundary between Thebes and Plataea.
