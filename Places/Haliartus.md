# Haliartus

Ἁλιαρτος a town in Boeotia.  

> [Strabo 98.30] 30 Haliartus is no longer in existence, having been rased to the ground in the war against Perseus; and the country is held by the Athenians, a gift from the Romans. It was situated in a narrow place, between the mountain situated above it and Lake Copais, near the Permessus and Olmeius Rivers and the marsh that produces the flute reed.

By Pausanias' time it was also abandoned, so probably empty in P's day.  The Haliartia (Ἁλιαρτία), or territory of Haliartus, was a very fertile plain, watered by numerous streams flowing into Lake Copais, which in this part was hence called the Haliartian marsh.[13] These streams bore the names of Ocalea, Lophis, Hoplites, Permessus, and Olmeius. The territory of Haliartus extended westward to Mount Tilphossium, since Pausanias says that the Haliartians had a sanctuary of the goddesses called Praxidicae situated near this mountain.[14] The towns Peteon, Medeon, Ocalea, and Onchestus were situated in the territory of Haliartus.

The stream which flowed on the western side of the city is the one called Hoplites by Plutarch, where Lysander fell, and is apparently the same as the Lophis of Pausanias.[18] The stream on the eastern side, called Kefalári, is formed by the union of two rivulets, which appear to be the Permessus and Olmeius, which are described by Strabo as flowing from Helicon, and after their union entering Lake Copais near Haliartus. The tumulus, of which Leake speaks, perhaps covers those who were killed along with Lysander, since it was near this spot that the battle was fought.

The territory was well watered and fertile, which makes it curious why it was still abandoned in P's time. Presumably there were farms (owned by absentee Athenian landlords) but no town?  Maybe Plataeans -- who had Athenian citizenship, at least at some points in time -- were the owner class?
