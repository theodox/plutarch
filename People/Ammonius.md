P's teacher, much beloved.  P wrote a biography, now lost.  

He may be the Ammonius of Lamprae (in Attica) quoted by Athenaeus (xi) as the author of a book on altars and sacrifices (Greek: Περὶ βωμῶν καὶ Θυσιῶν). Athenaeus also mentions a Περὶ τῶν Ἀθηνσινῆ Ἑταιρίδων written by an Ammonius (xiii).

He was a "strategos" at Athens -- not, at this point, a military post. 

He predeceased P (not surprising).

According to Eunapius he was from Egypt 
> Philostratus of Lemnos in a superficial and agreeable style spat forth the Lives of the most distinguished sophists; but the lives of the philosophers no one has recorded accurately. Among these latter were Ammonius of Egypt, who was the teacher of the divine Plutarch, and Plutarch himself, the charm and lyre of all philosophy; Euphrates of Egypt and Dio of Bithynia, whom men surnamed the "Golden-mouthed"; and Apollonius of Tyana, who was not merely a philosopher but a demigod, half god, half man. For he was a follower of the Pythagorean doctrine, and he did much to publish to the world the divine and vivifying character of that philosophy. But Philostratus of Lemnos wrote a full account of Apollonius, and entitled his book The Life of Apollonius, though he ought to have called it The Visit of God to Mankind. Carneades also lived about this time, a celebrated figure among the Cynics, if indeed we ought to take any account of the Cynic school,4 among whom were Musonius, Demetrius, and Menippus, and several others also; but these were the more celebrated. Clear and accurate accounts of the lives of these men it was impossible to discover, since, so far as I know, no one has written them. But their own writings were and |349 still are sufficient records of their lives, filled as they are with such erudition and thorough research in the field of ethics and also that research which aspires to investigate the nature of things and disperses like a mist the ignorance of such as are able to follow. Thus, for example, the inspired Plutarch records in statements scattered here and there in his books, both his own life and that of his teacher; and he says that Ammonius died at Athens. But he does not entitle these records a Life, though he might well have done so, since his most successful work is that entitled The Parallel Lives of men most celebrated for their deeds and achievements. But his own life and that of his teacher he scattered piecemeal throughout every one of his books; so that if one should keep a sharp look-out for these references and track them as they occur and appear, and read them intelligently one after another, one would know most of the events of their lives. Lucian of Samosata, who usually took serious pains to raise a laugh, wrote a life of Demonax, a philosopher of his own time, and in that book and a very few others was wholly serious throughout.

(Note Eunapius is wrong:  P wrote a life of Ammonius, in the Lamprias catalog, but it's lost)

(Note:  Eunapius, in the 4th c, is high testimony to the rep of P already...)




> Some there be, moreover, who after a more cleanly and fine manner in speaking of others, admonish their own familiar friends: for they will accuse strangers in their hearing for those faults which they know them to commit, and by this means reclaim them from the same. Thus Ammonius, our master, perceiving when he gave lecture in the afternoon that some of us his scholars had taken a larger dinner, and eaten more than was meet for students, commanded a servant of his affranchised to take up his own son and to beat him, and why so? He cannot forsooth make his dinner (quoth he) but he must have some vinegar to his meat. And in saying so, he cast his eye upon us, in such sort that as many as were culpable took themselves to be rebuked, and thought that he meant them.

(This leads to an interesting digression about berating people in public; P is against that!)

How to tell a flatterer from a friend, 70 (Quomodo adulator ab amico internoscatur )

Ammonius is a character in _de defectu_, _e Delphico_ and 3 of the _quaestiones conviv_

In dialogs, Ammonius is on familiar terms with Lamprias (2) . 

has a son, Thrasyllus (_quaestiones_ 720C)

CP Jones (jstor above) says that in some dialogs, P and Lamprias are clearly students of Ammonius, in others they seem to have taken the lead with their old teacher.
