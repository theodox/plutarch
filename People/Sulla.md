# Sextius Sulla

A friend of Plutarch.  A citizen of Carthage, and maybe of Punic ethnicity:

> down to the present time, Talasius is the nuptial cry of the Romans, as Hymenaeus is of the Greeks; for they say that Talasius was fortunate in his wife.
But Sextius Sulla, the Carthaginian, a man who lacks neither learning nor charm, told me that Talasius was the word which Romulus gave as a watchword for the rape.

Romulus 15.2
