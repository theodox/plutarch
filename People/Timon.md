# Timon

P's brother, presumably his younger brother ([Lamprias](/People/Lamprias_2.md) was the older.)  


Tsavoulas does not follow Zeigler, 1954, who believes Timon was a step brother.

From Tsavoulas:

Timon does not speak in 619B-F, he was present at that conversation. Timon, like his brother Plutarch,
was a self-professed admirer of Alexander (557B) and the host of dinner parties
that afforded socializing with the well-connected men of his day. In Mor. 615C-E
and 616C-616F, he is the lax host of a large party that included friends,
magistrates and kinsmen from home and abroad; his laxity caused a dispute
between him and his father, who was keen on attending to the proper etiquette
regarding sitting arrangements at a dinner party. In a number of the Moralia,
Timon appears to be younger than Plutarch. In the essay on Brotherly Love (Mor.
478A-492D), Plutarch provides a number of paradigms of devotion and
admiration between a younger and an older brother (487C-D) and concludes

those remarks by writing that Timon’s affection for him has always been above
all else, a fact that was well known to their friends, Quietus and Nigrinus, the
two brothers to whom Plutarch dedicated this essay (487E, cf. 478B).29 Timon
also appears as an interlocutor in Mor. 548B, 549E, 556E-557E; he was well versed
in mythology and history, but was unable to compete very successfully with his
brother’s wide-ranging knowledge. He was often interrupted and his arguments
were criticized by an older and broadly-trained Plutarch.30 In 639B-D, Timon
once again shows off his knowledge of Homer and is beaten down by his
brother’s comments. In fragments 177 and 178 from the essay On the Soul
attributed to Plutarch in Wyttenbach’s edition of the Moralia, Timon appears
versed in Platonism and Epicureanism, however, which suggests that he, too,
received philosophical training.
