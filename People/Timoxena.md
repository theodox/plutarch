# Timoxena, daughter of Alexion

P's wife. They married circa 68.



the Consolatio makes her out to be like P himself; grave, mellow, not showy. 
 > But we, my dear wife, in our relations with each other have had no occasion for the one quarrel, nor, I think, shall we have any for the other. For, on the one hand, your plainness of attire and sober style of living has without exception amazed every philosopher who has shared our society and intimacy, neither is there any townsman of ours to whom Dat religious ceremonies, sacrifices, and the theatre you do not offer another spectacle — your own simplicity.

Married life started a bit rocky:
> For a long time before we were born, when our father had newly espoused our mother, an unlucky variance that fell out between their parents caused him to take a journey to Thespiae, with an intention to sacrifice to the God of Love; and he carried my mother also to the feast (for that it properly belonged to her as well to make the feast as to perform the sacrifice)"

She was a Dionysiac initiate (Consolatio, 10)

4 boys, one "much wished for" girl who died young.

>  you have already shown great steadfastness in circumstances like the present, when you lost your eldest child and again when the fair Charon left us. For I remember that strangers accompanied me in my journey from the sea and gathered at our house with the rest at the news of the little child's death; and observing great composure and quiet, as they later recounted to othersº they thought that no tragedy had occurred, and that a false report had got abroad — Esuch was the self-possession with which you kept order in your household at a time that gave full scope to disorderly  p591 confusion, and yet you had nursed him at your own breast and had submitted to surgery when your nipple was bruised. For such conduct was noble, and it showed true mother love.23


1 daughter, also Timoxena.  Died at two.  He was returning from Athens when he got the news
 
> Do, however, try to carry yourself back in your thoughts and return again and again to the time when this little child was not yet born and we had as yet no complaint against Fortune; next try to link this present time with that as though our circumstances had again become the same.​32 For, my dear wife, we shall appear to be sorry that our child was ever born​33 if our conduct leads us to regard the state  p597 of things before her birth as preferable to the present. EYet we must not obliterate the intervening two years from our memory; rather, since they afforded us delight and enjoyment of her, we should credit them to the account of pleasure; and we should not consider the small good a great evil, nor, because Fortune did not add what we hoped for, be ungrateful for what was given.

Her mother observed a very mellow mourning:
> It is rather in our ancestral and ancient usages and laws that the truth of these matters is to be seen; for our people do not bring libations to those of their children who die in infancy, nor do they observe in their case any of the other rites that the living are expected to perform for the dead, as such children have no part in earth or earthly things; nor yet do they tarry where the burial is celebrated, at the graves, or at the laying out of the dead, and sit by the bodies. For the laws forbid us to mourn for infants, holding it impiety to mourn for those who have departed to a dispensation and a region too​50 that is better and more divine.​51 And since this is harder to disbelieve than to believe, Blet us keep our outward conduct as the laws command, and keep ourselves within yet freer from pollution and purer and more temperate.52
