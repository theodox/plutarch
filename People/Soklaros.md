# Lucius Mestrius Soklaros


Son of P.  Mentioned in [Moralia, 15A](/Works/Quomodo_Adulescens.md) as an adolescent.

Probably, he shows up as judge in a boundary dispute in Chaeronea under Hadrian (as consul w/ Salinator), which would mean he survives P.  Otherwise this would be his grandson, which is unlikely.  However since he is not in the dedication of the [De Animae Procreatione in Timaeo](/Works/De_Animae_Procreatione.md) maybe he died young?

see Babut, “À Propos des enfants et d’un ami de Plutarque: essai de solution pour deux enigmes,” REG 94 (1981) and “Sur Soclaros de Chéronée et sur le nombre des enfants de Plutarque: méthodologie d’une mise au point,” RPh 73 (1999)

Note proportion of Roman citizen to Greek names here:  6 to 12 in the first case, 2 to 11 in the second.  Maybe some good local names here:

> I, T. Phlaouios Euboulos, judge and boundary-setter appointed by Kasios Maximos the
proconsul, supervised (or retained?) by Oualerios Seoueros, proconsul, between Zopyros
son of Aristion and Parmenon, son of Zopyros, and Memmios, son of Antiochos,
concerning the disputed places, having heard from both parties for as long as they wished
and having attended the demonstratio, and having been ordered to deliver a verdict by
Klodios Granianos, the most excellent proconsul, I judge as follows. Of the field
Dryppios, which Memmios Antiochos bought for himself from the heirs of Kleon, as I
understand from the documents presented to me, (I judge that) 435 Phocic plethra belong
to Antiochos. Whatever should be found to be more than this, I judge to belong to the city
of the Daulieoi. Similarly, of the field Euxyleia, 430 plethra I judge to be Antiochos’, the
remainder to be the city’s. Of the estates Platanos and Moschotomeai, 230 plethra I judge
to be Antiochos’, the rest the city’s. I judge that the origin point of the field survey should
be established wherever Antiochos wishes in each of the fields Dryppios and Euxyleia,
but in Platanos and Moschotomeai there will be one survey origin for both estates, with
the survey proceeding continuously from the appointed origin, not including in the
surveyed area streams, rough areas, or areas that cannot be cultivated that are over ten
sphyrai. Present: T. Phlaouios Euboulos delivered the verdict and affixed his seal,
L. Mestrios Soklaros, Kleomenes, son of Kleomenes, Neikon, son of Symphoros,
Lamprias, son of Neikon, Zopyros, son of Antipatros, Sosibios, son of Drakon, Neikon,
son of Alexandros, Leon, son of Theodotos, Kallon, son of Phylax, Kassios, son of
Martianos.

> (Side b:) By a decree of the city. The road to the (shrine of the) founder shall be two
kalamoi wide. They shall engrave jointly the landmarks and boundaries of the survey by
the twentieth day of the twelfth month, with us reviewing them when they are engraved.
Concerning the field called Dryppios, in accordance with the document presented by
Serapis, son of Sopyros the legal representative and by the archons for(?) Philon, son of
Sosikrates and Damon, son of Zopyros, we judge that if there should be anything lacking
from the measurements of four hundred thirty-five plethra in the verdict of Euboulos, that
Serapis will have a claim for it from the city of the Daulieoi. Present: I, Kourrios
Autoboulos, have judged and affixed the first seal. I Neikeiphoros, son of Lykomedes,
have judged. I, Agasias, son of Teimon, have judged. I, P. Aelios Damoxenos have
