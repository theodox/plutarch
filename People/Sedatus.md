#  Marcus Sedatus

Addressed in Moralia 15 A as the father of "Cleander", who is a young man around the same age as [Soklaros](Soklaros.md).  This probably puts the father as a contemporary of P, +/- maybe 10 years.

The gens might be the [gens Sedatia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sedatia_gens#Praenomina).  Might be the Marcus Sedatius Myro of [AE 1987](https://db.edcs.eu/epigr/epi_url.php?s_sprache=en&p_publication=AE+1987%2C+00078&r_sortierung=Belegstelle), a tomb inscription fron Rome, since that Marcus has a brother Apollinaris and P. addresses someone of that name in the [Numa](Works/Numa.md).  Myro is a Greek name (the classical sculptor Myron) as is Cleander, but Plutarch addresses him by his Roman nomen.
