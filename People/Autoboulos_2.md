# Autoboulos (2)

Son of Plutarch. Survived his father.  A character in [Quaestiones Conviviales](/Works/Questiones_conviviales.md). Narrator of [Amatorius](/Works/Amatorius.md). Mentioned in the prologue to [De Animae Procreatione in Timaeo](/Works/De_Animae_Procreatione.md). The name means "keeps his own counsel".  Remarkable for his ability (in the dialog) to reproduce the whole conversation faithfully. Plutarch hosted his wedding at Chaeronea (666D)



> Autoboulos followed in his father’s footsteps as a Platonist philosopher and teacher.177 A certain L. Mestrios Autoboulos, a Platonic philosopher, appears on a late first-early second century CE inscription from Chaironeia; 178 considering that Mestrios was also one of Plutarch’s Roman names, we can suggest that L. Mestrios Autoboulos of IG VII 3423 is Plutarch’s firstborn son, who continued the family’s Platonic tradition.
