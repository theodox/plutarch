ὀλίγον δὲ πρὸ Πυθίων τῶν ἐπὶ Καλλιστράτου πρὸς ἡμᾶς ἀπὸ τῶν ἐναντίων τῆς οἰκουμένης περάτων ἔτυχον **ἄνδρες ἱεροὶ** δύο συνδραμόντες εἰς Δελφούς, **Δημήτριος μὲν ὁ γραμματικὸς ἐκ Βρεττανίας εἰς Ταρσὸν ἀνακομιζόμενος οἴκαδε**,  Κλεόμβροτος δ᾽ ὁ Λακεδαιμόνιος, πολλὰ μὲν ἐν Αἰγύπτῳ καὶ περὶ τὴν Τρωγλοδυτικὴν γῆν πεπλανημένος, πόρρω δὲ τῆς Ἐρυθρᾶς θαλάσσης ἀναπεπλευκὼς οὐ κατ᾽ ἐμπορίαν, ἀλλ᾽ ἀνὴρ φιλοθεάμων καὶ φιλομαθὴς

He may be the author of a Περὶ Ἑρμνηνείας (https://doi.org/10.1093/acrefore/9780199381135.013.2104) which is mistakenly attributed to Demetrius of Phalarum.


There's a chance he is the dedicator of a mosaic in Gaziantep, Turkey, to "Okeanos and Tethys" http://edithorial.blogspot.com/2014/04/from-tarsus-to-wales-earliest-greek-in.html -- but this is a longish way from Tarsus. Maybe also of a dedication in York: https://romaninscriptionsofbritain.org/inscriptions/662, this is considered disputed


>  Demetrius of Tarsus is good
humoured, self confident, and gets things to the point even if other
participants give long and winding explanations. Demetrius has a certain social
standing and made explorations in Britain on the emperor’s orders.29 He is a
learned man, although typical for a grammarian he knows Homer by heart,
different to Plutarch’s brother Lamprias who asked him to quote some verses.
In the same text, one of the guests tries to tease him twice with general
statements about the boring and laborious interpretations of grammarians, but
is only laughed at by the good humoured Demetrius. Even though Demetrius
is introduced to the dialogue together with Cleombrotus both as holy men,
obviously an ironic characterisation, only Cleombrotus turns out to be
credulous and a little simple-minded, but Demetrius poses the central
question, adds interesting details and gives a turn to the conversation.
