# Sextus Claudius Autobulus

P's nephew.  A tutor of Marcus Aurelius.  Must be a son of one of the Autobouluses (clarify).  Mentioned in Apuleius, I -- hes' the link that Apuleius claims to P's family on his mother's side.

This branch of the family were famous in Chaeronea for generations: 

Σέξτον Κλαύδιον Αὐτόβουλον‎, ὁμώνυμον τῷ‎
πατρί‎, ἕκτον ἀπὸ‎ Πλουτάρχου‎, ἀρετὴν πᾶσαν‎
ἐν βίῳ καὶ λόγοις ἐπιδειξάμενον‎, ἐντ‎<ελ‎>[ῆ‎]
φιλόσοφον‎, ἐτῶν‎ [κ‎]βʹ‎, ἡ πρὸς μητρὸς‎
μάμμη Καλλίκλε‎[ια κα‎]ὶ οἱ γονεῖς καὶ αἱ ἀδελ‎-
φαὶ τ‎<ὸ‎>ν ἥρω‎[α‎]. <ψ‎>η‎[φίσματι‎] β‎(ουλῆς‎) δ‎(ήμου‎)

(p.21) Sextus Claudius Autobulus, of the same name
as his father, sixth in descent from Plutarch, whose all-round excellence
was displayed in his life and in his words, aged [thirty]-two, (was honoured)
by his maternal grandmother Callicleia and his parents and his
sisters as a hero. By the decree of the Council and the People.

(IG vii 3425, Chaeronea -- mid 3rd century)

Sextus remained famous down to the late 3rd century, but later authors confused him with Sextus Empricus
