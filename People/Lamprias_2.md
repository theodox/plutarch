# Lamprias son of Aristobulus

P's older brother.  Narraotr of _De Defectu_.  Must be eldest son of Aristobulus (1).  Archon of Delphi ca. 115.

Appears in the _E apud_; makes a joke which only Ammonius gets (386).  His level of comfort here is reason to think he is P's older brother. 

In _de defectu_ Lamprias is a main speaker, and Ammonius goes to him for advice -- in this case Lamprias is not jokey.
