Domitian
---------
Paranoid emperor. b. 24 October 51; d 18 September 96 (aged 44)  Emperor from 81 to 96. Popular with the army and, to some degree, the people; unpopular with the aristocrats.  Assassinated. 

Domitian did a lot of building in Egypt, supported traditional cults. Big builder elswhere as well. Supported cult of Isis/Minerva and Serapis/Jupiter at Rome.

He upped the currency at first (2.8 g > 3.26) but in 85 cut back (3.04 g).  

His campaign against the Chatti was derided as a "mock war." but he took the title "Germanicus"  Under him Agricola completed conquest of Roman britain. Biggest crisis, Dacian War of 85. Had to cut a deal with Dacians to focus on a German war in 89.

Instituted Capitoline Games in 86

He revived the imperial cult after Vespasian and Titus had let it wane. 
In 87, scandal with Vestal Virings:
> "...and the incest of Vestal Virgins, condoned even by his father (Vespasian) and his brother (Titus), he punished severely in diverse ways, at first by capital punishment, and afterwards in the ancient fashion (buried alive). For while he allowed the sisters Oculata and also Varronilla free choice of the manner of their death (AD 83), and banished their lovers, he later (AD 90) ordered that Cornelia, a chief-vestal who had been acquitted once but after a long interval again arraigned and found guilty, be buried alive; and her lovers were beaten to death with rods."



In 94 he expelled all the philosophers from Rome (Epictetus said "philosophers can look tyrants in the face")

"He used to say that the lot of Emperors was most unfortunate, since when they discovered a conspiracy, no one believed them unless they had been murdered"


Apollonius of Tyana
-----------
Cappadocian (probably Aramaic-speaking) mystery worker and neo-Pythagorean. Either 40 years older than P or a contemporary.  Transcendentalist, critic of blood sacrifice (quoted by Porphyry later)  A (apocryphal?) letter to Delphi critiques this too:



Gaius Musonoius Rufus
------------------
Roman stoic (20? - 101).  The only philosopher exempted from Vespasian's expulsion of philosophers in 71, but eventually exiled again in 75.  Teacher of Epictetus and Dio Chrysostom.  Supposedly corresponded with Appollonius of Tyana. Similar in outlook to Epictetus; mostly focused on ehtics. Banished by Nero (65) but returned under Galba (68) Musonius was able to accuse, and obtain the conviction of, Publius Egnatius Celer, the Stoic philosopher who had condemned Barea Soranus.

Opponent of child exposure; adovdcated women should be allowed to philosophize.
