#family 

Legendary king of Thessaly.  P's family claimed descent from Opheltias.

> At a slightly later point in the city’s early history Plutarch reports that when Peripoltas the mantis brought king Opheltas and his people to Boeotia from Thessaly he ‘left behind a family which remained distinguished for many years, and of it most settled in Chaeronea, the first city they seized when they drove out the barbaroi’: γένος εὐδοκιμῆσαν ἐπὶ πολλοὺς χρόνους κατέλιπεν‎, οὗ τὸ πλεῖστον ἐν‎ Χαιρωνείᾳ‎ κατῴκησεν‎, ἣν πρώτην πόλιν ἔσχον ἐξελάσαντες τοὺς βαρβάρους‎.8 Here Plutarch, with characteristic reserve, does not reveal that he is himself one of the Opheltiadae,9 but as with his references to Chaeronea in his Theseus and Demosthenes, it may not be accidental that his readers find this item in the Life of one of the subjects he chose from Athens’ much more glorious past.
