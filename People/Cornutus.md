# L. Annaeus Cornutus


A Stoic philosopher from Leptis, a city of Libya; he lived in Rome at the time of [sc. the emperor] Nero, by whose orders he was banished along with Musonius. He wrote many works, both philosophical and rhetorical (Suda)

NOTE: My original note forgot to memtion where he's referenced by P. A footnote to [De Facie](/Works/De_Facie.md) implies P borrowed a simile about fire from him, but that seems too minor for a note...
