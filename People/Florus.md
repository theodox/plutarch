# Lucius Mestrius Florus

A consular (date uncertain, prob. before 69).  Accompanied Otho "unwillingly" to Bedriacum. He later showed P. the sites of the battlefield.  Presumably sponsored P's citizenship, since P. took his Latin name.

If he was consul before 69, probably in 65 (suffect w/ Firmus). But he'd be quite old when proconsul of Asia in 87.  Otherwise, perhaps suffect consul in 86 (w/ Q Vibius Secundus) or 84 (two slots)

Proconsul of Asia in 87/8 under Domitian (coins in his name: https://rpc.ashmus.ox.ac.uk/search/browse?magistrate_id%5B%5D=278)

Dium in Macedonia mentions a P. Mestrius in an inscription: 

AE 2000, 1295:
> On the orders of P. Mestrius Pomponianus Capito, son of Gaius, of the Palatine tribe,
duumvir and of Mestria Aquilina, daughter of Gaius, priestess of Minerva, C. Mestrius
Priscus Maianus, son of Gaius, of the Palatine tribe, and Numerius Mestrius, son of Gaius,
of the Palatine tribe (set up) an inn with two tabernae (?public rooms) and the furniture
which is listed below: five sleeping couches, five mattresses, five pillows, ten benches, two
armchairs, a bronze dining couch, three mattresses, three emitulae (?banquet cushions),
three long pillows, an iron hearth, twenty tables, twenty cots, twenty emitulae (?banquet
cushions). All of these things they supervised at their own expense for the inhabitants of
the colony and likewise they dedicated them.

These Mestrii are of the Palatine tribe, which suggests origins as freedmen at some point. 

> TODO there is more in the Pauly-Wissowa XV about this under "mestrius"
