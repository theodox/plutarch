De sera numinis, 22.5 (566e), 

during a vision of the underworld.   

>Among other things, he heard what was prophesied concerning the mountain Vesuvius, and the future destruction of Dicaearchia by fire; together with a piece of a verse concerning a certain emperor or great famous chieftain of that age, _Who, though so just that no man could accuse, Howe'er his empire should by sickness lose_

This stuff probably dates the reference to the 70's: Pompeii, the fire in Puteoli/Dicaearchia, and Titus.
