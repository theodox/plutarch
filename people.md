Lucius Mestrius Florus
---------------------
A "consular" (date uncertain, prob. before 69).  Accompanied Otho "unwillingly" to Bedriacum; later showed P. the sites of the battlefield.  Must have sponsored P's citizenship, since P. took his Latin name.

If he was consul before 69, probably in 65 (suffect w/ Firmus). But he'd be quite old when proconsul of Asia in 87.  Otherwise, perhaps suffect consul in 86 (w/ Q Vibius Secundus) or 84 (two slots)

Proconsul of Asia in 87/8 under Domitian (coins in his name: https://rpc.ashmus.ox.ac.uk/search/browse?magistrate_id%5B%5D=278)

Dium in Macedonia mentions a Mestrius in an inscription: 

AE 2000, 1295:
> On the orders of P. Mestrius Pomponianus Capito, son of Gaius, of the Palatine tribe,
duumvir and of Mestria Aquilina, daughter of Gaius, priestess of Minerva, C. Mestrius
Priscus Maianus, son of Gaius, of the Palatine tribe, and Numerius Mestrius, son of Gaius,
of the Palatine tribe (set up) an inn with two tabernae (?public rooms) and the furniture
which is listed below: five sleeping couches, five mattresses, five pillows, ten benches, two
armchairs, a bronze dining couch, three mattresses, three emitulae (?banquet cushions),
three long pillows, an iron hearth, twenty tables, twenty cots, twenty emitulae (?banquet
cushions). All of these things they supervised at their own expense for the inhabitants of
the colony and likewise they dedicated them.

Soklaros (L. Mestrius Soklaros)
---------------------------
 -- must be a son of P.  Shows up as judge in a boundary dispute in Chaeronea under Hadrian (cc 2, w/ Salinator).  Maybe some good local names here:

> I, T. Phlaouios Euboulos, judge and boundary-setter appointed by Kasios Maximos the
proconsul, supervised (or retained?) by Oualerios Seoueros, proconsul, between Zopyros
son of Aristion and Parmenon, son of Zopyros, and Memmios, son of Antiochos,
concerning the disputed places, having heard from both parties for as long as they wished
and having attended the demonstratio, and having been ordered to deliver a verdict by
Klodios Granianos, the most excellent proconsul, I judge as follows. Of the field
Dryppios, which Memmios Antiochos bought for himself from the heirs of Kleon, as I
understand from the documents presented to me, (I judge that) 435 Phocic plethra belong
to Antiochos. Whatever should be found to be more than this, I judge to belong to the city
of the Daulieoi. Similarly, of the field Euxyleia, 430 plethra I judge to be Antiochos’, the
remainder to be the city’s. Of the estates Platanos and Moschotomeai, 230 plethra I judge
to be Antiochos’, the rest the city’s. I judge that the origin point of the field survey should
be established wherever Antiochos wishes in each of the fields Dryppios and Euxyleia,
but in Platanos and Moschotomeai there will be one survey origin for both estates, with
the survey proceeding continuously from the appointed origin, not including in the
surveyed area streams, rough areas, or areas that cannot be cultivated that are over ten
sphyrai. Present: T. Phlaouios Euboulos delivered the verdict and affixed his seal,
L. Mestrios Soklaros, Kleomenes, son of Kleomenes, Neikon, son of Symphoros,
Lamprias, son of Neikon, Zopyros, son of Antipatros, Sosibios, son of Drakon, Neikon,
son of Alexandros, Leon, son of Theodotos, Kallon, son of Phylax, Kassios, son of
Martianos.
> (Side b:) By a decree of the city. The road to the (shrine of the) founder shall be two
kalamoi wide. They shall engrave jointly the landmarks and boundaries of the survey by
the twentieth day of the twelfth month, with us reviewing them when they are engraved.
Concerning the field called Dryppios, in accordance with the document presented by
Serapis, son of Sopyros the legal representative and by the archons for(?) Philon, son of
Sosikrates and Damon, son of Zopyros, we judge that if there should be anything lacking
from the measurements of four hundred thirty-five plethra in the verdict of Euboulos, that
Serapis will have a claim for it from the city of the Daulieoi. Present: I, Kourrios
Autoboulos, have judged and affixed the first seal. I Neikeiphoros, son of Lykomedes,
have judged. I, Agasias, son of Teimon, have judged. I, P. Aelios Damoxenos have
affixed the fourth seal. I, Eisidoros, fifth. Metrodoros, son of Apollodotos of Antikyra.
Neikaretos, son of Pistos of Tithorea. Tyrannos, son of Tyrannos have affixed (this) seal.
Akindynos, son of Kallikrates of Tithorea. Sex. Kornelios Axiochos. Eunous, son of
Epaphras. Kalligenes, son of Keoneikus of Tithorea have affixed (this) seal. 

Mestrios Aristonymos
--------------------
Maybe another son of P? Active in a land dispute under Hadrian ca. 125.  More details here (https://isaw.nyu.edu/members/tom.elliott-40nyu.edu/downloads/epigraphic-evidence-for-boundary-disputes-in-the-roman-empire)

This was a long running dispute with the town of Thisbe, lasting at least 20 years


Domitian
---------
Paranoid emperor. b. 24 October 51; d 18 September 96 (aged 44)  Emperor from 81 to 96. Popular with the army and, to some degree, the people; unpopular with the aristocrats.  Assassinated. 

Domitian did a lot of building in Egypt, supported traditional cults. Big builder elswhere as well. Supported cult of Isis/Minerva and Serapis/Jupiter at Rome.

He upped the currency at first (2.8 g > 3.26) but in 85 cut back (3.04 g).  

His campaign against the Chatti was derided as a "mock war." but he took the title "Germanicus"  Under him Agricola completed conquest of Roman britain. Biggest crisis, Dacian War of 85. Had to cut a deal with Dacians to focus on a German war in 89.

Instituted Capitoline Games in 86

He revived the imperial cult after Vespasian and Titus had let it wane. 
In 87, scandal with Vestal Virings:
> "...and the incest of Vestal Virgins, condoned even by his father (Vespasian) and his brother (Titus), he punished severely in diverse ways, at first by capital punishment, and afterwards in the ancient fashion (buried alive). For while he allowed the sisters Oculata and also Varronilla free choice of the manner of their death (AD 83), and banished their lovers, he later (AD 90) ordered that Cornelia, a chief-vestal who had been acquitted once but after a long interval again arraigned and found guilty, be buried alive; and her lovers were beaten to death with rods."



In 94 he expelled all the philosophers from Rome (Epictetus said "philosophers can look tyrants in the face")

"He used to say that the lot of Emperors was most unfortunate, since when they discovered a conspiracy, no one believed them unless they had been murdered"


Apollonius of Tyana
-----------
Cappadocian (probably Aramaic-speaking) mystery worker and neo-Pythagorean. Either 40 years older than P or a contemporary.  Transcendentalist, critic of blood sacrifice (quoted by Porphyry later)  A (apocryphal?) letter to Delphi critiques this too:



Gaius Musonoius Rufus
------------------
Roman stoic (20? - 101).  The only philosopher exempted from Vespasian's expulsion of philosophers in 71, but eventually exiled again in 75.  Teacher of Epictetus and Dio Chrysostom.  Supposedly corresponded with Appollonius of Tyana. Similar in outlook to Epictetus; mostly focused on ehtics. Banished by Nero (65) but returned under Galba (68) Musonius was able to accuse, and obtain the conviction of, Publius Egnatius Celer, the Stoic philosopher who had condemned Barea Soranus.

Opponent of child exposure; adovdcated women should be allowed to philosophize.

P quotes him : https://topostext.org/people/1297


Cornutus
