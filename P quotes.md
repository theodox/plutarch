marriage
-------
> Philosophers say of bodies that some are composed of separate elements, as a fleet or an army, others of elements joined together, as a house or a ship, and still others form together an intimate union, [p. 325] as is the case with every living creature. In about the same way, the marriage of a couple in love with each other is an intimate union ; that of those who marry for dowry or children is of persons joined together: and that of those who merely sleep in the same bed is of separate persons who may be regarded as cohabiting, but not really living together

(He goes on to talk about Leptis -- maybe heard this from Cornutus?)

> In Leptis, a city of Africa, it is an inherited custom 1 for the bride, on the day after her marriage, to send to the mother of the bridegroom and ask for a pot. The latter does not give it, and also declares that she has none, her purpose being that the bride may from the outset realize the stepmother's attitude in her mother-in-law, and, in the event of some harsher incident later on, may not feel indignant or resentful.


wives
-----
> The generals issued orders to the Greeks in Cyrus's army,1 that if the enemy advanced shouting they should receive them with silence, but, on the other hand, if the enemy kept silent, they should charge against them with a shout. Women who have sense keep quiet while their husbands in their fits of anger vociferate, but when their husbands are silent they talk to them and mollify them by words of comfort

bulls, elephants
------------
> Those who have to go near elephants do not put on bright clothes, nor do those who go near bulls put on red1 ; for the animals are made especially furious by these colours ; and tigers, they say, when surrounded by the noise of beaten drums go completely mad and tear themselves to pieces.2 Since, then, this is also the case with men, that some cannot well endure the sight of scarlet and purple clothes, while others are annoyed by cymbals and drums, 3 what terrible hardship is it for women to refrain from such things, and not disquiet or irritate their husbands, but live with them in constant gentleness ?

women
-----
>It is said that no woman ever produced a child without the co-operation of a man, yet there are misshapen, fleshlike, uterine growths originating in some infection, which develop of themselves and acquire firmness and solidity, and are commonly called ‘moles.’ 5 Great care must be taken that this sort of thing does not take place in women's minds. For if they do not receive the seed of good doctrines and share with their husbands in intellectual advance [p. 341] ment, they, left to themselves, conceive many untoward ideas and low designs and emotions.

witchcraft
----------
>  And if anybody professes power to pull down the moon from the sky, she will laugh at the ignorance and stupidity of women who believe these things, inasmuch as she herself is not unschooled in astronomy, and has read in the books about Aglaonice, 4 the daughter of Hegetor of Thessaly, and how she, through being thoroughly acquainted with the periods of the full moon when it is subject to eclipse, and, knowing beforehand the time when the moon was due to be overtaken by the earth's shadow, imposed upon the women, and made them all believe that she was drawing down the moon.

This "pull down the moon" thing in Thessaly was common belief; cf. Apuleius.

marriage, boeotisa
--------------
> In Boeotia, after veiling the bride, they put on her head a chaplet of asparagus ; for this plant yields the finest flavoured fruit from the roughest thorns, and so the bride will provide for him who does not run away or feel annoyed at her first display of peevishness and unpleasantness a docile and sweet life together.

marriage
---------
> Helen was fond of wealth and Paris of pleasure; Odysseus was sensible and Penelope virtuous. Therefore the marriage of the latter pair was happy and enviable, while that of the former created an ‘Iliad of woes’ for Greeks and barbarians.

responsibility
---------
> Epameinondas, when all the Thebans crowded to a certain festival and gave themselves utterly to drink, Dwent alone and patrolled the armouries and the walls, saying that he was keeping sober and awake that the others might be free to be drunk and asleep

Incarnation
---------------
> For it is neither probable nor fitting that God is, as some philosophers say, mingled with matter, which is altogether passive, and with things, which are subject to countless necessities, chances, and changes. On the contrary, somewhere up above in contact with that nature which, in accordance with the same principles, remains always as it is, established, as Plato​13 says, upon pedestals of holiness, proceeding in accordance with nature in his straight course, he reaches his goal
